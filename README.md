# Topics in Parallel Computing

This repository contains the two projects I developed for Athens University of Economics and Business' "Topics in Parallel Computing" class (INF489 - 3822), which I took during the spring semester of the 2022-23 academic year. Each directory contains descriptive README files which sum up the assignment guidelines.
